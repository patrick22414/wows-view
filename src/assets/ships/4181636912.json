  "description": "A heavy cruiser that matched most ships of her type in terms of speed and the power of her armament. The ship boasted distinct advantages typical of the German Navy's ships, i.e. an advanced gun fire control system and a high level of survivability. Those advantages were the result of the ship's decent armor protection, rugged construction, and her elaborate subdivision into compartments.",
