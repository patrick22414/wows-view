  "description": "One of the most sophisticated destroyers in the Japanese Navy. This ship was specifically designed to provide anti-aircraft defense. Due to her significantly increased dimensions, she was equipped with new dual-purpose main gun mounts that had a very high rate of fire. Among the drawbacks of the ship were the relatively weak torpedo armament and an insufficiently high speed.",
