  "description": "One of the most advanced light artillery cruisers in the U.S.S.R. Navy. The ship was as good as most of her foreign counterparts in terms of speed and armor. The cruiser's key advantage over other ships of her type was her main battery that boasted a very long firing range due to the successful design of turret mounts.",
