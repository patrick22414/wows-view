  "description": "A Battleship of the \"Fleet of Fog\". Modelled after the Imperial Japanese Navy's 3rd Kong≈ç-class battleship, Haruna. First seen engaging I-401 in combat alongside Kirishima, she was defeated by the superior tactics of Gunzo Chihaya, commander of I-401. Her Mental Model \"Haruna\" always wears a large overcoat and has a keen interest in the human language, \"collecting\" word samples as she hears them.\nThis warship has been specially designed for World of Warships, and is modelled after Haruna as she appears in \"ARPEGGIO OF BLUE STEEL -ARS NOVA-\".",
