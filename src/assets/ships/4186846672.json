  "description": "The ship belonged to the first series of Russian destroyers to be equipped with turbines. Derzky boasted good survivability owing to a high speed combined with dimensions that were comparatively large for her time. Until the very end of World War I, she had been unrivaled in terms of the number of torpedoes that could be launched in a broadside salvo.",
