Ships of this class were designed to confront the weakly protected cruisers that were built after the Washington Naval Treaty of 1922.Â At the time of their entry into service, they had the best armor among ships of their type. The international displacement-limiting treaties, which were still in force during the ship's construction, were the reason why no torpedo weaponry was mounted on her.",
