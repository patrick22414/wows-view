  "description": "One of the first cruisers in the U.S. Navy that was built to conform to the requirements of the Washington Naval Treaty. The ship shared several distinctive features with the cruisers that were subject to the treaty restrictions, namely powerful artillery and weak armor. The ship carried 203 mm main guns, which allowed her to be classified as a heavy cruiser soon after her commissioning. However, the armor protection was consistent with that of a light cruiser.",
