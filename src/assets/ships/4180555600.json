  "description": "The most powerful large destroyers (French \"contre-torpilleurs\") among those built for the French Navy. Due to the placement of her artillery guns in twin mounts, the ship outgunned not only all of her predecessors in terms of firepower, but also most contemporary destroyers. Another special feature of the Mogador-class ships was the arrangement of their torpedo armament, where two torpedo tubes were placed along each side of the ship.",
