  "description": "This heavy aircraft carrier project, designed at the end of World War II, represented a further development of the Implacable class. Her large dimensions allowed her to overcome the major drawback of her predecessorsâ€”the relatively small number of airplanes she could carry onboard. The aircraft carriers initially laid down as the Audacious class were completed much later, in the 1950s, with a significantly modified design.",
