  "description": "A Heavy Cruiser of the \"Fleet of Fog\". Modelled after Takao, the lead ship of the Imperial Japanese Navy's Takao-class cruisers. She loses a duel against I-401 while patrolling the Kumano Sea area. After her defeat, she decides to leave the \"Fleet of Fog\" to join the \"Blue Steel\" led by Gunzo Chihaya. Takao's Mental Model has a great deal of curiosity, which led her to unwittingly collect a lot of information about humanity.\nThis warship has been specially designed for World of Warships, and is modelled after Takao as she appears in \"ARPEGGIO OF BLUE STEEL -ARS NOVA-\".",
