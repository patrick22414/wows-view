  "description": "The lead ship in a series of large destroyers (\"contre-torpilleurs\"), a typical type of ship in the French Navy, designed specifically to hunt down enemy destroyers. The ship was large in size and had a high speed. She was on par with contemporary destroyers by the strength of her torpedo armament yet considerably outclassed them in terms of artillery power owing to her five 139-mm guns.",
