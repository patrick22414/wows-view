  "description": "The warship belonged to a series of U.S.-built \"flush-deckers\". In 1940, she was transferred to the U.K. Along with her extremely powerful torpedo armament, Campbeltown was also noted for uncommonly high speed for that era. The distinctive placement of her torpedo tubes allowed her to quickly concentrate torpedo fire on either side.",
