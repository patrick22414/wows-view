  "description": "The first Japanese cruiser built after the Washington Naval Treaty of 1922 came into force. Unlike foreign Treaty Cruisers, Myōkō's armor was good enough to withstand artillery strikes from ships of the same type. One of the features of the project was well-developed torpedo protection. Following a series of upgrades, cruisers of this class got a substantially reinforced AA and torpedo armament.",
